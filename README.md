# Project Management System



![ProjectManagement2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65809527/100575860-43b48f80-32dd-11eb-8609-110eb549a9a3.gif)



*I tried to simulate the project management system in this project.

*In this Project you can access the system with two roles:

  **Project Manager**
  
  **Team Member**

# Scenario:

*If you are a team member,you can only access the projects given to you,  you can create or update the project and you can  send a **CLOSE REQUEST** at the end of the project

*If you are a manager, you can  access the all projects ,you can **DELETE** the project, update it and create a new project.

# Development Strategy:

*In Development Phase i have used Firebase Services 
  Firebase Auth--->For Authentication
  FireStore ---->For CRUD operations
  User Infos  is stored under "users" collection in firestore.
  Project details are  stored under "projects" collection.
  Notifications are stored under "notifications" collection.
 
* For Global State Management i have used **REDUX** with enhancer **THUNK**
 
* For Styling i have used **Styled Components**

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
